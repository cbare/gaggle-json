<h1>Testing with curl</h1>

<p>One way to test out this or any other web service is the command line utility <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">curl</a>. Here's how to perform the
basic CRUD operations with Gaggle data objects with curl.</p>

<h2>Object IDs</h2>
<p>Gaggle data objects are identified by a unique ID, like the ones below. When you store
  an object in the database, it will be assigned an ID, so it can be referred to later.
  Object can be organized into projects, so there's no need for users to keep track of
  identifiers, but we use them for programmatic access.</p>

<h2>Get an object</h2>
<pre>
curl http://myserver.net/documents/4da60f351ff236120b000003
</pre>
<p>Of course, you could easily put this URL into a browser as well. The next examples
  upload files containing JSON objects to the server.</p>

<h2>Insert a new object</h2>
<pre>
curl --request POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --upload-file namelist.json http://myserver.net/documents/
</pre>
<p>This takes a namelist in file and stores it on the server. Take note of the ID
  returned by this call and use it in the next two calls.</p>

<h2>Update an existing objects</h2>
<pre>curl --request PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --upload-file updated.namelist.json http://myserver.net/documents/4db8cb031ff2363559000001</pre>
<p>This updates the namelist, perhaps adding some genes of interest.</p>

<h2>Deleting an object</h2>
<pre>curl --request DELETE http://myserver.net/documents/4db8cb031ff2363559000001</pre>
<p>If need be, we can delete an object as well.</p>
